		<p>The inception of Bistro can be attributed to the lack of quality eateries in Nepal. As a restaurant, we have struggled to come to terms with the standards the Nepali consumer is accepting on a daily basis.</p>
		<p>Foreseeing a world of progress where we discover new realms of customer satisfaction.</p>
		<p>Starting as a friendly neighborhood store, we group which has based its development on its founding values of honesty, innovation and friendliness.</p>
		<p>Our position in the Nepal is pushing us to further develop our retail/Hospitality activities by reinforcing our brand visibility and develop new retail/ Hospitality formats under the Nepal House brand in the country of Nepal.</p>
		<p>Following& the economic liberalization of the 80’s and 90’s, an influx of market participation and consumer culture has characterized the growing middle class in Kathmandu. In recent years, the rise of this economic middle class has brought many forms of social change throughout the city. One reflection of this change is the rapidly developing restaurant business and urban foodculture. In the past, Kathmandu’s restaurants were primarily visited by tourists and the upper-class elite. Now, Nepalese are dining in 'western-style’ restaurants with increasing frequency.(As per article Restaurant Business and Nepal’s Urban Middleclass)</p>
		<p>Due to change in lifestyle of Nepalese people, the trend of celebrating different life events like birthday, anniversary, family and friends gathering etc. in restaurant is increasing gradually in Nepal. So it’s agreat opportunities for restaurant to gain competitive advantage by being different in this crowd. Life style of people, Income, Ambience, variety  of food ,time constraints and Easy accessibility are the factor influencing consumer preference for restaurant.</p>
